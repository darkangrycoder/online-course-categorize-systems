By the end of this course you will have the knowledge to work with large sets of data faster and easier than you ever thought possible. This course uses the tidyverse libraries in R which provide an elegant solution for solving 99% of our reporting requirements. Tidyverse is incredibly well supported and by focusing solely on this one set of libraries we can massively shortcut the amount of time that is required to get up and running with R. Many beginner courses in R will start teaching what is known as base R which covers the original methods for working with R that have been enhanced and simplified through the tidyverse. Although it maybe useful to have some understanding of base R it is neither a requirement of this course or a requirement to becoming really productive in the R language. As we go through the exercises we are going to be comparing to the most common way that processes are typically carried out in Excel.']"
