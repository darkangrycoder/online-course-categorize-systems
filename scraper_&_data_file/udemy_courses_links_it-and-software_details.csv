I lecture to my students about cyber threat intelligence sources and types, basic definition and terms like IOC, TTP, Cyber Kill Chain Model, Incident Response Steps. I critisize security devices capabilities for explaining why we need monitoring and SIEM infrastructure. In the second module I give you therotical knowledge about real attack techniques like SQL Injection, Buffer OverFlow Exploit Codes, SSH tunneling methods and more... I teach to my students how to collect full pcap traffic and which tools should be used for analysing. In module two I analysis tunnels, pivot points, web attacks, Remote Code Execution Exploits, Web Shells and Web attacks traffic from pcap files and I share my real world analysis experince with my students. In third module, First I present the fundamental windows processes and process injections, hollowing techniques and tools, pe injection and thread injection techniques and tools as theoritically. Then I teach you dumping memory samples for memory forensic and I analyze Stuxnet attack's memory image, Cridex, Zeus, Darkcomet Rat's Memory images and DLL injection event's memory image. In fourth module I perform therat hunting over ELK. First I explain the event id numbers which are used common for hunting and I analyze a real life scenerio. I detected malicious word documents, hta files, unsigned exe files, vbs files and more. I teach you how to detect and investigate tunneling methods, persistency methods like registeries, services, schedule tasks.
